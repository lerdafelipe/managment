### General Info

<a name="general-info"></a>
The project was ended and was delivered, but if I learn more technologies and see that technology is better for the project, I will add it because i want the best portfolio posible. The initial view has two buttons, the first to download a product list in a file .csv, the second opens a popup window to add a new product, a search bar and a table with the existing products, the table contains product info, and two buttons, the first to remove the product from DDBB and the second to edit the product info.
The view /ventas, temporarily, contain a table with the daily sales and information about them. Soon, I thought to add statistics, a redirect to sale-details for each sale.
The view /compras contains a product cards list to add products to the cart and them record the daily sale.
Finally, the view /cart, contains a table of products added to the cart with information of the daily sale and an input type date to select the day to record.
